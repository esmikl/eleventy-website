<p>Hello! I'm Emily Mikl, a Front End Developer based out of Altoona, Wis. I'm currently employed
at First Citizens Bank as the lead developer of our corporate design system, Evolve. Outside of work I'm a mom to four kids, and the commander of a robot army.</p>
<p>I changed careers after 13 years in the newspaper business when I was tasked with updating our online newspaper on a content management system. I didn't like being confined within the templates, and wanted to learn <em>how</em> this system worked behind the scenes. In the spring of 2013, I quit my job and went back to school to earn my Associates Degree in Software Development from Chippewa Valley Technical College in Eau Claire, Wis.</p>
<p>After graduating tech school, I was hired full-time as a front end developer at Great Lakes in Eau Claire, which later was acquired by Nelnet.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Wisconsin, I am a diehard Wisconsinite. I love camping and kayaking in the summer, visiting apple orchards and wineries in the fall, and snuggling with my extensive blanket collection in the winter. I love baseball, and love watching the Eau Claire Express play at legendary Carson Park in Eau Claire (where Hank Aaron, Bob Uecker, and Joe Torre played). I cheer on the Milwaukee Brewers and the Minnesota Twins, my childhood favorite team.</p>
<p>When I'm not working or volunteering at local charities, I love watching home renovation shows and cooking shows, and re-runs of "I Love Lucy" and "Golden Girls".</p>
<p>I'm passionate about people, and delivering exceptional user experiences for everyone is what drives me. I have a soft spot for people with disabilities, and strive for inclusivity in everything I deliver.</p>
