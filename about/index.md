<p>Hello! I'm Emily Mikl, a Front End Developer based out of Eau Claire, Wis. I'm currently employed
at Nelnet, Inc., as the lead developer of our corporate design system, <a href="https://unifi.nelnet.io/" target="_blank">Unifi</a>. Outside of work I'm a wife, mom to four kids, dog mom to a golden doodle, student, and volunteer.</p>
<p>I changed careers after 13 years in the newspaper business when I was tasked with updating our online newspaper on a content management system. I didn't like being confined within the templates, and wanted to learn <em>how</em> this system worked behind the scenes. In the spring of 2013, I quit my job and went back to school to earn my Associates Degree in Software Development from Chippewa Valley Technical College in Eau Claire, Wis.</p>
<p>After graduating tech school, I was hired full-time as a front end developer at Great Lakes in Eau Claire, which later was acquired by Nelnet.</p>
<p>My company offers tuition assistance, so in August of 2019 I started pursuing my Bachelors Degree in Information Science & Technology from UW-Stout. When the pandemic hit and I had to home-school my kids, I took a break from school, returning in September of 2021 to online classes through UW-Milwaukee.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Wisconsin, I am a diehard Wisconsinite. I love camping and atv riding in the summer, visiting apple orchards and wineries in the fall, and snuggling in my Green Bay Packers blanket by my fireplace in the winter. My husband Levi and I love baseball, and love watching the Eau Claire Express play at legendary Carson Park in Eau Claire (where Hank Aaron, Bob Uecker, and Joe Torre played). We love the Milwaukee Brewers, and I cheer on my childhood team of the Minnesota Twins.</p>
<p>I am on the school marketing committee at my kids' school, on the evangelism team at my church, and LOVE volunteering for our Jesus Cares group at church - an organization that ministers to adults with cognitive disabilities.</p>
<p>When I'm not working or volunteering, I love watching home renovation shows and cooking shows, and re-runs of "I Love Lucy".</p>
